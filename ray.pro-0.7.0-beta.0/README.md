## Disclaimer

We only borrowed the **operation interface** of Raycast, and **did not modify the backend server** of Raycast.

We just coded a proxy server to forward Raycast's requests to our proxy server, and **implemented similar functions** in Raycast Pro Plan **in other ways**.

## Getting Started

~~Please follow the documentation at [wibus-wee.github.io/raycast-unblock](https://wibus-wee.github.io/raycast-unblock/)!~~
